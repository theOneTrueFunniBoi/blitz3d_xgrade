<h1>Description</h1>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
When specific Blitz3D functions are run (and debug mode is disabled), these functions will check to make sure the information they are trying to parse is valid.
<br />
If the information is invalid, instead of continuing on or raising a runtime error, the function will be ended and the error message will be pushed back into an error log.
<br />
<br />
Using ErrorLog(), you can retrieve the error that has occured, as well as any furthur errors.
<br />
<br />
Fun fact: this function is where the "MAV-Less" in "Blitz3D MAV-Less" comes from.
